Labour Force Survey Project


Purpose: This is a small project examining sickness absences in occupations 
with a focus on healthcare occupations in BC in the year 2018-2019 (Pre-pandemic). 
This work is closely related to my master's thesis.

Data: This project utilizes the Canadian Labour Force Survey Data in 2018 and 2019. 
More details here: https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/survey/household/3701 


I have attached the combined dataset for years 2018 and 2019 which can be used for analysis. 
The analysis I conducted is only for the main purpose above.

Language: I am using SAS.
